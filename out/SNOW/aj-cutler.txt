Riding on skis the size of snowblades, the sport soon became as natural as walking. “[When] I was a ski instructor for a little bit, I had to learn how to teach skiing,” she laughed. “Because it’s just muscle memory for me.

However after a two year hiatus, Cutler craved that time in nature and wanted a way to share her experiences outside with others. So, she started her blog, Nacforadventure. “I wanted a way to share my experiences for people who were just getting into [outdoor activities] and had questions,” she explained. “But to be honest, it was mostly for me.

I’m obviously presenting very feminine, which opens [the door] for more criticism.
